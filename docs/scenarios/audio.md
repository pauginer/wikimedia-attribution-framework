From voice assistants to podcasts, Wikimedia content is frequently shared in spoken form. In voice-based experiences, attribution shouldn’t be minimized, but instead adopt an auditory format that blends seamlessly with the medium. 

Recommendations in this context will try to ensure that essential attribution is made as clear and accessible as in text-based or visual environments. Audio formats will also facilitate the communication of certain trust signals, which purpose is to reinforce the reliability of the information provided to listeners.
