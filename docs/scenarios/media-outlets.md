# Media and Publications

Online media outlets frequently reuse text, images and structured data from Wikimedia projects in order to support or illustrate news stories. Attribution practices in these contexts vary broadly, and omissions are quite extended due to time and technical constraints. 

The use of clear and accessible attribution signals is key in media outlets, to ensure the identification of Wikimedia as a relevant source of both established and timely information. Signals will ensure compliance with licensing, the fair recognition of the work of open knowledge contributors, and establish our projects as accurate sources in the information ecosystem.

> :information_source: We’re currently working on defining attribution specifications for media and publications. More detailed guidance for this scenario will be included in future updates to the framework.
