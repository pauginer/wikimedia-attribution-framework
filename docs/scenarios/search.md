## Attribution Guidelines

When displaying Wikipedia content in search results, ensure you include:

1. **Essential Attribution Signals:**

   - Source name (e.g., "Wikipedia" or "English Wikipedia")
   - Brandmark (favicon or project logo)

2. **Recommended Attribution Signals:**
   - Activity indicators (e.g., "Most read", "Active today")
   - Contributor count
   - Page view statistics
   - Reference count
   - Call-to-action links (e.g., "Contribute to Wikipedia")

These signals help users understand the source and nature of the content, while also providing pathways for engagement with Wikipedia.
