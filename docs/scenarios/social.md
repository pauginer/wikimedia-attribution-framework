# Social media

Wikimedia content is shared at scale in social media platforms, usually in the form of images, links to pages and Wikipedia article snippets. The fast, casual and remix-heavy nature of social media contexts often leads to attribution loss: sources might be omitted, images circulate without context. Social sharing patterns pose a challenge to ensuring trust in the accuracy or origin of the information being reused. 

This scenario is essential because social media does play a major role in shaping public opinion and understanding. Effective attribution becomes critical in this context. The goal is to provide clear, visually embedded signals that help preserve source recognition and sustain trust, while blending with familiar platform conventions and user flows. 

Our recommendations will focus on ensuring that knowledge derived from Wikimedia projects can be tracked back to its origin, perceived as reliable thanks to the incorporation of trust signals, and easily accessible by audiences of social feeds.
