# Games and Rich media experiences

Apps and games frequently draw on Wikimedia content to power narratives and interactive experiences, frequently focused on learning. These contexts rely on creating immersive environments to draw user engagement, which may cause sources to naturally be less visible. 

We identified games and educational apps as key scenarios because they highlight the need for attribution patterns that can integrate seamlessly within interactive environments. The goal in the context of this reuse scenario is to ensure that Wikimedia’s contributions remain clear, trusted, and recognized, while still respecting the focused player and user experience.
