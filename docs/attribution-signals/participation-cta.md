# Participation CTA

Participation CTAs are context-appropriate prompts that invite end users to contribute to Wikimedia projects from off-platform experiences. In the context of Wikipedia, for example, these CTAs might encourage users to add images or links, or translate articles to new languages.

The goal of these interventions is to co-create pathways of contribution, to channel the audience interest into on-wiki participation, and promote the sustainability of the volunteer ecosystem that keeps Wikimedia’s content high quality and up-to-date.

## Implementation guidance {#implementation}

### Minimum requirements

- Coordinate with Wikimedia to define participation interventions that better fit your context in terms of appearance and labeling, and determine which predefined contributions pathways (e.g., structured or recommended edit tasks in Wikipedia) could be used.

- Keep essential attribution primary: Participation CTAs are secondary attribution interventions and they must not obscure or replace primary signals (see Source, Author, Link/Access, Title, etc.).

### Best practices

- If usage data is available, the recommended practice is to target users who consistently demonstrate curiosity about Wikimedia content (e.g., consistently navigate to the Wikimedia sources shared).

## Reuse scenarios

Participation CTAs can turn off-platform attention into constructive contributions on Wikipedia, helping reusers improve result quality over time while helping sustain the volunteer ecosystem that powers the content they rely on. This intervention is specially adequate in the following scenarios:
